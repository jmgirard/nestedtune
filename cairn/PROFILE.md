# Toolchain profile: r-package

<!-- A cairn *toolchain profile*: the language/toolchain-specific slots the
     operational skills read. cairn-init instantiates this into the repo's
     `cairn/PROFILE.md`. The oracle / Validation doctrine is UNIVERSAL and
     deliberately NOT a slot here — it is the orthogonal domain axis
     (D-024/D-025), stated once in skills/shared/validation-doctrine.md
     (referenced from tracking-rules). All seven `## <slot>` sections
     are defined; cairn_validate FAILs on a missing or empty slot. -->

The R-package toolchain: devtools/roxygen/testthat/pkgdown, CRAN release.
Selected by `cairn-init` when a `DESCRIPTION` file is present.

## verify
Run by `/milestone-implement` (per task) and `/hotfix` (gate-lite):
- After roxygen changes: `Rscript -e 'devtools::document()'`.
- After code changes, before a task is checked off: `Rscript -e 'devtools::test()'` clean.
- `/hotfix` gate-lite: `devtools::test()` clean; `devtools::document()` if
  roxygen changed; `devtools::check()` if anything structural was touched.

## consistency-gate
Toolchain checks `/milestone-review` runs *in addition to* the universal
cairn-file checks (`cairn_validate`, coverage completeness, `cairn_impact`):
- `devtools::document()` produces no diff.
- Generated files are never hand-edited: `NAMESPACE`, `man/`, and `data/*.rda`
  regenerate from roxygen and `data-raw/` scripts (the no-diff `document()`
  check catches drift).
- README.md is knitted from README.Rmd; present and out of sync with README.md → `devtools::build_readme()`, commit.
- pkgdown site present → `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()` passes (catches exports missing from `_pkgdown.yml`).
- The declared changelog (`## changelog` slot) has an entry for this milestone's user-visible changes (no milestone numbers in user-facing text).
- New top-level files have `.Rbuildignore` entries (check `check()` NOTEs).
- Full check at review: `Rscript -e 'devtools::check()'` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings; justify NOTEs).

## test-doctrine
R-mechanical test expectations layered on the universal "What gets a test"
rules in tracking-rules:
- Tests are written for `testthat` edition 3 (3e).
- Every exported function: happy path, every `cli_abort()` branch fired, R
  edge cases — zero rows, `NA`, length-one, factor vs. character, empty strings.
- New user-facing conditions use `cli::cli_abort()` / rlang, not assertthat.
- Indirect by default: internal helpers (direct tests only for independent logic).
- Never test print cosmetics beyond meaningful snapshots, trivial pass-throughs,
  dependency behavior, or plots except `vdiffr` when the plot is the product.
- `covr` is a diagnostic, never a gate.
- CI starts from the usethis pair: `check-standard` runs `R CMD check` across
  platforms (a normal CI check — see the merge clause below), `test-coverage` runs
  `covr` to Codecov, annotating a PR but never gating it; `.github/` is `.Rbuildignore`d.
- Four divergences from that stock shape (M11 ×2, M12, M14). **A `concurrency`
  block** cancels a superseded run on every ref but the default branch, a
  distribution channel that keeps a completed check instead. **A `paths-ignore`
  filter** on both triggers of both gating workflows skips `cairn/**`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/**`, which cannot change what `R CMD check` sees — that
  is the test a fourth path must meet; it bites on `push` only, GitHub
  evaluating it on a `pull_request` against the whole PR diff. **A
  `timeout-minutes: 20`** on each gating job turns a hang into a failed job with
  a timestamp — both have hung inside `test_check("nestedtune")` for 52 and 40
  minutes on a tree that passed an hour earlier — and is not free headroom: an
  ordinary windows leg has reached 11m54s and 1 of 394 jobs passed 20 minutes
  and still finished, so the cap would have failed that one. **A
  `workflow_dispatch`-only stress workflow** (`stress-daemon-tests.yaml`) hunts the
  hang on demand, invisible to `ci-usage.py` for carrying neither trigger.
- Locating a hang, since the cap only ends one: `HangTraceReporter`
  (`tests/testthat/helper-hang-trace.R`) writes a timestamped start/end line per
  test file and per `test_that()` block to unbuffered `stderr()`, so a killed
  job's last unmatched `start` names the block it died in (M14, per-test M16).
- `.github/ci-usage.py` measures the first two over any window in GitHub's
  90-day retention (baseline: `.github/ci-usage-baseline.md`), counting commits
  from `git log` and never crediting a cancelled run its whole would-be duration.
- **The merge clause, for the filters:** cairn never merges red or pending CI. A
  filtered event produces no run, so its check is absent rather than pending and
  merging past it is correct; what it forbids is a check that ran and failed, or
  one still running. Required status checks (none here) would leave a filtered
  check `Pending` forever.
- Change governance: the dependency surface is DESCRIPTION Imports/Suggests, and
  a breaking change warns via `lifecycle::deprecate_warn()` before removal. The
  gates themselves are universal (tracking-rules "Universal tracking rules").
- Every newly exported object gets a `_pkgdown.yml` reference-index row in the same commit.
- Every committed test fixture carries reproducible provenance: its source, the
  committed `data-raw/` generator that rebuilds it from scratch, and any seed —
  the R-mechanical form of the universal Reproducibility hard-stop. That content
  is required; its shape is the repo's choice (a `provenance` attribute, embedded
  `.rds`/`.rda` fields, or a header comment naming source + generator + seed).

## release-walk
Followed by `/cairn-release` — a CRAN release walk (never self-submits):
- Version decision (patch/minor/major) from the declared changelog; pre-1.0 conventions per DESIGN.md.
- Changelog consolidation (the declared file): retitle the dev heading to the version; group entries; prune noise.
- Full local verification: `devtools::document()` (no diff), `devtools::test()`
  and `devtools::check()` clean, `devtools::build_readme()`, `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()`,
  `urlchecker::url_check()`.
- Wide checks as applicable: `devtools::check_win_devel()` and/or R-hub; `revdepcheck` if dependents exist.
- Update `cran-comments.md` (test environments, check results, NOTE justifications, revdep summary).
- Bump `Version:` in DESCRIPTION.
- Handoff checklist (user runs): `devtools::submit_cran()`, confirm the CRAN
  email, then `usethis::use_github_release()` + `usethis::use_dev_version()`.

## init-detection
Recognized by `cairn-init` when a **`DESCRIPTION` file is present** at the repo
root. Carries the `.Rbuildignore` `^cairn$` entry (keeps the tracking dir out
of the built package).

## greenfield-openers
Language-specific opener `cairn-init` asks in a new/empty R package. The
universal openers — distribution ambition (rendered here as **CRAN intent**) and
numeric-work-needs-oracle-verification — are asked by cairn-init's universal
layer, so they are not repeated here.

- **Compiled code?** Will the package include compiled code
  (Rcpp / RcppArmadillo / C / C++ / Fortran)?
  - Options: **pure R** (reversible default) · Rcpp · RcppArmadillo.
  - Consequence: compiled ⇒ a `src/` dir, `LinkingTo`, a C/C++ toolchain, and
    `R CMD check` compiling on every check. Adding compiled code later is
    additive, so the reversible default is pure R.
  - Lands in: DESIGN Conventions (a "compiled code via <pkg>" line) and informs
    the `verify` / `test-doctrine` check surface.

## changelog
The repo's changelog file, read by `/hotfix`, the release-walk, and the
consistency-gate: **`NEWS.md`** (the R-package convention).
